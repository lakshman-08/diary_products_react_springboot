Project Title: E-Commerce Dairy Products Catelog
Tech Stack: React, Spring Boot, MySQL, REST APIs

Description:
Developed a full-stack e-commerce web application for dairy products, enabling users to browse, search, and filter items efficiently. The application integrates a React frontend with a Spring Boot backend and a MySQL database, providing a seamless and responsive shopping experience.

Key Features & Implementation Details:

Preloaded Data with DataSeeder

Implemented a Spring Boot DataSeeder to automatically insert sample product and category data into the MySQL database at application startup.

Eliminated the need for manual data setup, ensuring consistent test and demo environments.

Dynamic Data Fetching with React Hooks

Used the useEffect hook in React to call backend APIs and load products dynamically when components render.

Integrated the Fetch API to retrieve data asynchronously from the Spring Boot REST endpoints, improving page responsiveness.

Category Filter for Quick Navigation

Built an intuitive category filter on the frontend to display products by type (e.g., milk, cheese, butter).

Implemented backend query endpoints to serve category-specific results efficiently.

Smart Search Functionality

Designed a search feature with real-time filtering to help users quickly find products by name or keyword.

Optimized database queries using LIKE operations to deliver accurate results without performance degradation.

Outcome / Impact:

Delivered a production-ready full-stack application showcasing strong knowledge of React (state management, hooks), Spring Boot (REST APIs, data seeding), and MySQL (schema design, CRUD operations).

Demonstrated end-to-end integration skills, from database initialization to responsive UI interactions.

Built a scalable and maintainable codebase suitable for further enhancements like shopping cart or user authentication.
